# PortfolioDesign

This project consists of several elements.<br/>
The first element, [OptimalPF](/OptimalPF/) is creating optimal 3 portfolios for a given list of assets. This means you can compose your portfolio based on optimal portfolios based on historic data.<br/> 
The second element, xxx (YET TO COME), will price options using different models. This means you can hedge assets using options on a more informed basis.
